# Character-Device-Driver-Lodable-Kernel-Module-Device-File
Inserting a Character Device Driver(Lodable Kernel Module) in a Running Kernel or Operating System

    • This project is used to insert a Device Driver(Lodable Kernel Module) in a running Kernel / Opeating System.
    
    • It is a Software based Devcie Driver.
    
    • By using this Device Driver we can insert the Character Device Driver in running Kernel.
    
    • We can write the data in the from User Space to Kernel Space i.e in the Device File.
    
    • We can read the data from Kernel Space which is written in the Device File to User Space i.e in the Client File.
